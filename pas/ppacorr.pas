{ Recipe kind 3 (doc/PREFLATE.md): a zlib-like predictor, and the
  corrections that make what it predicts the stream, bit for bit.

  The predictor follows the stream's own parse (a forced parse). At each
  token it proposes one from the bytes alone, as zlib's deflate_slow (or
  deflate_fast) would from the same place: hash chains over every position,
  longest_match with a chain, nice, good and lazy of the recipe's, the
  lazy match one position ahead; or, for an optimal parser, the longest
  match there (PF_LONGEST). Then the stream's real token is taken, and the
  predictor goes on from where that token ends. Only where the two differ
  is something coded: whether it is a literal, the length against the
  longest match there (a shorter one as its length symbol and its place in
  it), the distance as its rank among the candidates at least that long
  (runs of one byte skipped). Every other choice an encoder makes is coded
  the same way, against a guess: where a block ends (zlib's symbol count),
  its type (stored first, then fixed against dynamic by zlib's sizes), a
  stored block's length and pad bits, whether it is the last, a dynamic
  block's code lengths (the trees of zlib, libdeflate, miniz or zopfli over
  the block's own symbol counts: TPredParams.tree), HLIT, HDIST, how the
  lengths are run-length coded (zlib's on each tree or on both at once,
  libdeflate's, miniz's, zopfli's, or each symbol explicitly), the
  code-length code and HCLEN, a 258 written as 284. Every field of
  ppadeflate's TDeflateBlock and every token can be coded whatever it is
  (a verbatim escape where a guess has no room: a match's distance outside
  the rank walk, any code length), so every stream Decode reads has a
  kind-3 recipe.

  The corrections are binary decisions and small numbers, coded with
  ppaarith's arithmetic coder and adaptive bits of this unit's own; a
  token's main decisions mix several of them, each with its own context
  (an integer logistic mixer). Encoder and decoder run the same driver
  (Drive): the encoder gives it the stream's choices and it codes them,
  the decoder gets them back from it; the rebuild writes each block as soon
  as it has it (ppadeflate's TDeflWriter), so it holds one block's tokens,
  never the stream's.

  A recipe decodes only with the predictor and models that made it: they
  are frozen by PRED_VERSION (doc/PREFLATE.md, the versioning rule).

  The searches and the rank walk (the hot loops) are also in C
  (ppacorrc.c); this is their reference, and both give the same
  corrections. Our own code: the idea of a forced parse and of coding a
  distance as its rank among the candidates is preflate's (Dirk Steinke),
  none of its code; the tree builders reproduce libdeflate's, miniz's and
  zopfli's (NOTICE). }
